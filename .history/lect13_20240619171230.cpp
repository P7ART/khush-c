//Arrray and Pointer.
//An array is a collection of items which are of the similar type stored in contiguous memory locations.
//Sometimes, a simple variable is not enough to hold all the data.
//For example, letâ€™s say we want to store the marks of 2500 students; initializing 2500 different variable for this task is not feasible.
To solve this problem, we can define an array with size 2500 that can hold the marks of all students.
